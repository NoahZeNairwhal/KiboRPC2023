/*
public static void detectMarkersâ€‹(Mat image, Dictionary dictionary, java.util.List<Mat> corners, Mat ids)
Basic marker detection
Parameters:
image - input image
dictionary - indicates the type of markers that will be searched
corners - vector of detected marker corners. For each marker, its four corners are provided,
(e.g std::vector<std::vector<cv::Point2f> > ). For N detected markers, the dimensions of this array is Nx4.
The order of the corners is clockwise.
ids - vector of identifiers of the detected markers. The identifier is of type int (e.g. std::vector<int>).
For N detected markers, the size of ids is also N. The identifiers have the same order than the markers in the imgPoints array.
correct codification. Useful for debugging purposes. Performs marker detection in the input image.
Only markers included in the specific dictionary are searched. For each detected marker, it returns the 2D position of its corner
in the image and its corresponding identifier. Note that this function does not perform pose estimation.
Note: The function does not correct lens distortion or takes it into account. It's recommended to undistort input image
with corresponging camera model, if camera parameters are known SEE: undistort, estimatePoseSingleMarkers, estimatePoseBoard
